## FEATURE


### TODO
- tech radar
- simple view
- react sensor
- react view
- other tools integration for static node check (deadcode, vulnerabilities, etc..)

### DONE


## BUGS
- version is still looks strange, should fix that. Maybe add version or V or v when its only ^~x.y.z (x, y, z are numbers)?

### TODO


### FIXED
- repo name not shown for architect vis and nest js -> maybe the sanitize removed them
